# Thunderclap

### Overview

**Thunderclap** is a Python package providing the ability to build a weather database 
using user defined locations and dates. The idea is that reserchers who wish to include
certain weather variables in analysis can quickly build a time series based on user provided
latitude/longitude coordinates. Currently this package is tightly coupled to the **Darksky** 
API which is eventually being closed to the public ([read more here](https://blog.darksky.net/dark-sky-has-a-new-home/)).
However, the API will be available through the end of 2021.
